- dialogue box: Participant information. Please type participant number for Number and select Expression carefully depending on each participant.

3. Fill in the participant number in the dialogue box
4. Select either **articulation** or **dynamics** (check the checklist!)

### Instruction for the experiment
> Thank you very much for participating in our study. In this experiment, you are going to listen to a number of piano performances and be asked to judge whether each performance was produced in order to teach a musical expressive technique or not.

> In this block, you are going to listen to one piece with one notated musical expressive technique, which is articulation/dynamics.

- For articulation

> Articulation indicates the smoothness of sound. Legato means smooth, connected sound and staccato means sharp, shortened sound.

- For dynamics

> Dynamics indicates the loudness of sound. Forte means loud sound and piano means soft sound.

> Each performance was produced in order to either 1) teach the musical expressive technique (as a teacher) or 2) perform their best (as a performer). You will be asked to judge whether each performer had the intention to teach or not by pressing the 'Yes' < Left > or 'No' < Right > key.

...continue (follow the instruction in the experimental programme)...

#### Potential questions from participants
- What is articulation/dynamics? >> read the explanation above (but they should know this)
- How many pieces am I going to listen to? >> there is only one piece of music. However, the piece will be played with two different musical expressive techniques (either articulation or dynamics)

### 2nd Block
- Repeat the first block with **the other expression**

## Questionnaire
1. Double-click Questionnaire on Desktop
